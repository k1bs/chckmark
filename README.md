## What is chk(mark) ?

chk(mark) is a note-taking app that makes your life a little bit richer. By using markdown, your notes come to life!

This project will make use of a React(redux)/Rails stack, and will use an npm module to assist with the processing of markdown files.

* A user will be able to use markdown syntax while on the edit page...

![wireframe 2](/public/wire2.jpg)
* And then, on the view page, they will be able to see the markdown parsed properly.

## Anticipated challenges
I foresee that I will have difficulty implementing the parsing of the markdown, and presenting it in an editable format.

Also, creating the app using Redux will prove difficult as it will be my first time.

## Stages

#### MVP
A note taking app with full CRUD functionality, allowing for markdown syntax, with auth and multiple users.

#### Stretch
* Make notes sharable between users.
* Write tests for front and back end.
